"""
Use whichever methods... BFT or DFT 

BFS -> BFT?  

Incomplete list of directions: ... N S E W  Cardinal ones

Add cardinal directions for moving between rooms 

Can comment out the test to walk around manually

Breadth offers the least amount of back tracking?  


Hints- 
Pick a random unexplored direction ... causes a DFT ... walk back to the nearest room that does contain an unexplored path... 
So we could create a reverse path ... Set opposite values to each other as your append your current path; we can append that reverse path to the current path?  but need to figure out the logic of when that would be appropriate.  

Says you can use a BFS back to the shortest unexplored room... then we could search that... 

Instead of searching for a target vertex... searching for exit with '?'; append that to BFS queue

Convert BFS path to cardinal directions


We have the get_exits method, current room... 
Travel method on player is important
We want to continue traveling while theirs a list of to be visited.. once that is reached, we do the reverse of that ... 

So set cardinal directions equal to opposite of each other?  Check the exits but once executed, use an array of opposite values ... 


DFT (Stack .. PUSH/POP)
Add current room to the queue

So what sets/dictionaries do we need?  





While you haven't explored 500 rooms ... continue your search.  

Mix of Pseudocode and code:
    visited = {}

    While 500 >= len(visited)
