Day 1 Graphs:

Recursive algorithms hard to understand at first 
-Use UPER! 

Graphs have no restrictions compared to linked lists and binary trees 

Nodes can point to themselves! can loop etc...


Nodes are connected by edges
Can have weights on the edges... the pointers from nodes 
*If not shown, assume weight is 1

Edges can be directed or undirected (two way)
-if no directed nodes, the graph is called an undirected graph
